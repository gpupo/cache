This is a Caching library that implements PSR-6.

[PSR-6](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/cache.md) is (still) not accepted, hence this lib does not only contains a null-caching PSR-6 implementation,
it also contains a copy of the current (2014-09-24) PSR interface, and has this set as a composer "replace"
relation.
